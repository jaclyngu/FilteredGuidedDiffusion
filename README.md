## Code (now released!)
### Summary
We provide a lightweight implementation of FGD which contains all the core functionality described in our paper. Our code is based on the [ðŸ¤— diffusers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index) and [taichi lang](https://www.taichi-lang.org/) for efficient computation of the cross bilateral matrix. 

A full explanation of how to use our code is described in the jupyter notebook <em>demo.ipynb</em>. 

For questions regarding the code, or access to a more comprehensive set of fuctions (<em>although much less user friendly</em>) including experimental features, debugging, and evaluation, please contact both authors at zg45@cornell.edu and eey8@cornell.edu. 

### Setup 
We provide a <em>requirements.txt</em> file which contains the packages our implementation of FGD was tested on. Note running our code requires a GPU. 
```
diffusers==0.30.0
numpy==2.0.1
Pillow==10.4.0
pytorch_lightning==2.4.0
taichi==1.7.1
torch==2.4.0+cu118
tqdm==4.66.5
transformers==4.44.0
```
**Note:** <em>jupyter notebook is also required in order to run our demo as we do not provide a command line interface.</em>
